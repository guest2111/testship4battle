- at commit cdfb8ea7867dffeeb35143e311b6c0269fa13269 observed bug:
	- get_ship_position(self,pos) fails if pos is at border or checked position crosses border


- after refusing to continue automatic the next question was correct but after that again asking to confirm automatic
	--> imediately set boolean to False if declined
