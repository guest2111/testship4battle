- at commit cdfb8ea7867dffeeb35143e311b6c0269fa13269 observed bug:
	- get_ship_position(self,pos) fails if pos is at border or checked position crosses border


- after refusing to continue automatic the next question was correct but after that again asking to confirm automatic
	- observed at ffb469c88461833574e18ffb78d4bfbc78f2bcf9
	--> imediately set boolean to False if declined
	- corrected with 600c656e7ac06ed3dce5c59f71496e7a5263cbfe

- ships are never position on len(ship)-1 last rows horizontal and on len(ship)-1 last columns vertically
	-> slight cheat if user observes this behaviour
	<- no fix yet
